The U.S. presence had a destabilizing effect, ultimately leading to a civil war between the nation’s Shi’ite Muslim majority and the Sunni minority. This civil war also pulled in the Kurdish people, a minority Muslim group to the north, as well as Al-Qaeda, who had been previously absent from the country. During July 2006 alone, nearly 3,500 Iraqis were killed. More than half of the deaths occurred in the Baghdad area. In response, the U.S. increased troop deployments on an emergency basis.",

In 2004, the military began relying on National Guard units to meet troop requirements. To make up for staffing shortages, the U.S. outsourced jobs to private companies. These companies profited by supplying troops with housing, meals, and transportation, completing construction jobs, and providing military and diplomatic personnel. The Defense Department would later be criticized for accepting these contracts without competitive bidding and awarding them to companies such as Halliburton, which had close ties to Vice President Dick Cheney.",
