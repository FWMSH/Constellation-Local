In 2015, President Obama signed a new bill into law that reauthorized the Zadroga Act, extending the VCF through 2020. And, on July 29, 2019, President Trump signed into law H.R. 1327, The Never Forget the Heroes Act, also known as the VCF Permanent Authorization Act. The Act extends the VCF’s claim filing deadline from December 18, 2020, to October 1, 2090. The act appropriates all necessary funds to pay out the victims’ claims in perpetuity.`,
